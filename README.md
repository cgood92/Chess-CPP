Chess
=====

For a project in college I had to make a simple Chess game.
There are several obvious things to point out here.
1. The deliverable had certain requirements that I would not have worried about otherwise.  If there seems to be some weird business logic, then that is due to class requirements and not stuff that I would normally have done.
2. This was the first program I wrote in C++ using OOP mentality.
3. The program's code is not perfect, and I have not spent much time optimizing it.  If I did have time, I would have done so.  But this gives you a taste of my coding skills that is off the fly.
4. I did not originally use version control, therefore there are only a few commits shown here.
5. This was intended to be run from a Linux terminal.  Colors and other things will not show up well in a Windows environment
